## Overview

Special thanks to Dennis Ivanov for the amazing guide to build a full-stack e-commerce website with React and Django. Definitely learn a lot of things. In this project, I am using ReactJS as the frontend and Django as the backend. For the user authentication, I am using JSON Web Token. I am also implementing React Redux for state management.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Fetch API from the backend server.
- Able to add item to cart and save it to web local storage.
- User authentication functionality such as login, logout, edit profile and make transaction.
- Should be able to use the payment gateway (Paypal) to make a transaction.
- See the admin panel and edit the user role as well as the order confirmation and shipping.

## My process

### Built with

- ReactJS
- Bootstrap 4
- Django
- Mobile responsive
- PostgreSQL
- AWS S3
- JSON Web Token
- React Redux
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Actually this is my first ever real-world project where I am using API to communicate between frontend and backend. The way of how we serialize python dictionary into a JSON data and how to create a user authentication with JSON Web Token and customize to use refresh token which will last for 30 days. I just know that we can also store data such as user info and cart info to the local storage which I implemented it to the project. The only thing that is confusing is the state management part using React Redux, I think more project will make me understand more of the concept.

### Continued development

In the future, I might be making new design for the UI of the website.
